ðŸš€ Project: Redux State Management in a To-Do App

What I Did:

- Implemented state management using Redux for efficient handling of todo items.
- Added functionality to display success and error alerts for various actions.
- Created a dynamic UI with features to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks.
- Ensured that completed tasks are visually distinct with a line-through style.
Included a notification for task completion to enhance user experience.

Highlights:

- Streamlined the user experience with immediate visual feedback through alerts.
- Leveraged Redux for seamless state management and efficient data flow.
- Focused on clean, maintainable code with a clear structure.
